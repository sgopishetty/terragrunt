This module creates an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html[Elastic Container
Service (ECS) Service] on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html[Fargate] that you
can use to run one or more related, long-running Docker containers, such as a web service. An ECS service can
automatically deploy multiple instances of your Docker containers, restart any failed Docker containers, route traffic
across your containers using an optional Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), and optionally register the services to AWS
Service Discovery Service.
