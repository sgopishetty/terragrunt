This module creates an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html[Elastic Container
Service (ECS) Service] that you can use to run one or more related, long-running Docker containers, such as a web
service. An ECS service can automatically deploy multiple instances of your Docker containers across an ECS cluster (see
the link:/modules/ecs-cluster[ecs-cluster module]), restart any failed Docker containers, route traffic across your
containers using an optional Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), and optionally register the services to AWS Service Discovery
Service. Additionally, CodeDeploy blue/green deployments are supported as the module can be enabled to ignore CodeDeploy 
managed resources.

== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code
Library], a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Infrastructure as Code Library before, make sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/[How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library]!

=== Repo organization

* link:/modules[modules]: the main implementation code for this repo, broken down into multiple standalone, orthogonal submodules.
** link:/modules/ecs-cluster[modules/ecs-cluster]: use this module to provision an ECS cluster with ECS container
   instances.
** link:/modules/ecs-scripts[modules/ecs-scripts]: use the scripts in this module to configure private docker registries
   and register ECS container instances to ECS clusters.
** link:/modules/ecs-service[modules/ecs-service]: use this module to deploy one or more docker containers as a ECS
   service, with options to use ELBs (CLB, ALB, or NLB), Service Discovery, or Fargate.
** link:/modules/ecs-daemon-service[modules/ecs-daemon-service]: use this module to deploy one or more docker containers
   that run on a regular schedule.
** link:/modules/ecs-deploy[modules/ecs-deploy]: use the scripts in this module to run one or more docker
   containers as a one time task on an ECS cluster.
** link:/modules/ecs-deploy-check-binaries[modules/ecs-deploy-check-binaries]: use the python binary packages in this
   module to check ECS service deployments to ensure that they are active and healthy.
* link:/examples[examples]: This folder contains working examples of how to use the submodules.
* link:/test[test]: Automated tests for the modules and examples.


=== Gruntwork analysis

* link:/core-concepts.md#ec2-vs-fargate-launch-types[EC2 vs Fargate launch types]: A detailed comparison between the two
  available launch types for ECS, showing you the trade-offs between ECS container instances and Fargate.
